# HTTP Proxy Server

For this assignment, I was tasked with implementing an HTTP Proxy Server using the WinSock API. 

This application takes in HTTP Requests, passes them to the intended server, and forwards the response back to the client.

It is non-blocking for both accepting new clients and performing client operations.
