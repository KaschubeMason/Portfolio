# Kilonova
This project is my Junior year game project at DigiPen Institute of Technology. The team consisted of 16 cross-discipline members (6 programmers, 6 artists, 3 designers, 1 audio engineer)

I was the Lead AI Programmer and Enemy Task Force Lead for Kilonova. While on this team, I created and managed everything relating to enemies including but not limited to:
- 6 Enemy Logic Blueprints (3 normal enemies, 3 "boss" variation enemies)
- 3 Enemy Animation Graphs
- 6 Enemy Behavior Trees
- Spawning System

For the Enemy Task Force Lead aspect, I coordinated tasks for the members within the Task Force and communicated our progress to production. I gave feedback on animations, assisted designers with enemy placement and balance, and iterated upon enemy behaviors.

**High concept:** In this action-packed third-person combo combat game, you take control of Nova, on a quest to stop the evil Kilonova from enslaving and consuming a planet. Battle through waves of possessed creatures as you fight your way up to the Kilonova. Do you have what it takes to save the planet? Or will you fall victim to the Kilonova's power?

**Role:** Create Enemy and AI-related systems, iterate upon those systems through playtesting, and plan out tasks for Task Force members

This project was created in Unreal 5 and as a result, the code samples are Blueprints. I have included screenshots of relevant snippets of the file as well as a breakdown of each in their corresponding 'ReadMe' files.
