# Action List Project
This code is for a project in Unity in which I was tasked with creating a simple poker game using the Action List structure.

The two code files are as follows:

**ActionList.cs:** The actual implementation of the Action List structure itself

**Playback.cs:** This file contains code responsible for serializing player input throughout the session and replaying it in a new session.
