# Wavetable Synth

This project saw me implementing a Wavetable Synthesizer.

For the sake of this project, the application uses a pre-recorded sample in which I manually set loop points for.

The synthesizer includes a pitch wheel, a modulation wheel, global volume, and note velocity.
It also supports 2 note polyphony without clipping.
